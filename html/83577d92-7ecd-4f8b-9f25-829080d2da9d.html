        <p class="style8">Dear Traffic Hungry Marketer,</p>
        <p class="style9">If the CRAZY idea that you can click a few buttons, then sit back ‘n’ watch as thousands of new viewers press play on your videos excites you, then I recommend you read every word of this letter…&nbsp;&nbsp;Because as crazy, and I admit unlikely,
            as it seems, you’re about to discover…
        </p>
        <p class="style26">How A Quiet Revolution In Video Submission Is Waiting To Put YOUR Videos On Page 1 And Bring You More Views Than Age Of Ultron...</p>
        <p class="style21">I’m Chris. I’ve been in the video marketing business for over a decade.&nbsp;&nbsp;And let me make one thing incredibly clear:</p>
        <div class="row14"><img class="style22" src="https://designresources.assets.yotako.io/9lhfjbcjte17twm.png" alt="Vector Smart Object">
            <div class="row14column1">
                <p class="style23">I’m not a traffic guy.&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m a video guy.&nbsp;&nbsp;I got into this business because I love making videos.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="style24">But even I’ve got to admit… if no-one sees your video, it’s not going to make you any money.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may not like driving traffic… but you need to do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;But just because you need to do it, it doesn’t mean it’s fun.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="style25">My go-to was always paid traffic.&nbsp;&nbsp;Handing over my credit card to Facebook and Google, paying for clicks and then crying when the bill came through.&nbsp;&nbsp;I’d heard some people were doing great with organic traffic, but I’d never
            been able to make it work.&nbsp;&nbsp;I did the tags, and the keyword optimization, and all that on-page stuff people say you should do.&nbsp;&nbsp;All I got were a load of videos still sat on page 5 of YouTube (not even making it to Google!)
            and a conviction that SEO was more boring than a bureaucrat convention. </p>
        <p class="style19">Luckily, I knew a guy called AB Hannan...</p>
        <p class="style17">And when he heard me bitching about Google, he hit me up on Skype.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, AB Hannan isn’t just some random dude I know.&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s a top-flight developer and an SEO whizz… so when he said he’d prove to me that he could get videos
            to rank, I figured I’d listen.</p>
        <p class="style20">… And Boy Am I Glad I Did,&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Something Incredible Happened!
        </p>
        <p class="style18">Page 1 For [KEYWORD]&nbsp;&nbsp;Proof Page One Rankings Show Spike in Traffic&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 1 For [KEYWORD]&nbsp;&nbsp;Proof Page One Rankings Show Spike in Traffic&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 1 For [KEYWORD]&nbsp;&nbsp;Proof Page One Rankings Show Spike

        </p>
        <p class="style27">Of Course I Wanted To Know How It Was Done. And So He Explained…</p>
        <div class="row21">
            <p class="style29">Having your video hosted on one single website like&nbsp;&nbsp;Youtube is good. Having your video syndicated on multiple video sharing websites is even better.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? There are loads of video sites with built in audiences that savvy
                marketers are leveraging, but it’s not just about the views here.&nbsp;&nbsp;SEO always has been, and always will be about backlinks…&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, backlinking isn’t quite so effective for article marketing anymore… but that’s fine,
                because…&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p class="style30">Google’s Developed Such A Heavy Crush On Video That It’s Desperate To Splash Your Videos All Over Page One!</p>
        <p class="style33">Google WANTS your videos.&nbsp;&nbsp;It wants to give people lots of different types of content.&nbsp;&nbsp; And while articles are a dime-a-dozen, there’s not many videos for most keywords.</p>
        <div class="row24"><img class="style32" src="https://designresources.assets.yotako.io/9lhfjbcjte17v29.png" alt="Vector Smart Object">
            <p class="style31">The more your video gets syndicated to different websites, the more it helps in pushing your original video higher in Google.&nbsp;&nbsp;You get more views due to the natural rankings of all the other sites you’ve embedded your original video
                on.&nbsp;&nbsp;You also get to drive link juice to any Website URL of your choice by simply adding it in the description of your original video.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that means when you syndicate your videos to multiple sites, you
                pretty much can’t fail to get on page 1.

            refresh, it’ll arrive when it arrives…honest.) Fend off “brain-freeze” while you manually submit videos to each site. Find someway to fit in your “part-time new job” of copying and pasting the different data that's required by all these video
            sites.
